Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
ANS: Software engineering is a discipline that focuses on design, development and maintainance of software systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
ANS: Despite a seemingly close resemblance, software engineering and programming have some sinifincant differences. To begin with, programming mainly focuses on writing code to achieve a certain objective while software engineering deals with designing, developing and maintaining a software. In terms of collaboration, a software engineering project usually requires various roles such as designers, programmers, project managers, testers, devOps, etc while programming can be carried out by a single person. Lastly, a sftware enginnering project may reqire different tools and techniques such as version control systems, testing tools and many more while programming will just require a text editor software such VS Code.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
ANS:Software Development Cycle refers to the steps involved in building a software product. The main phases involved are:
1. REQUIREMENT IDENTIFICATION: This is the first phase in the cycle. It involves gathering user needs, expectations and constraints.
2. ANALYSIS: Defining the functionalities of the software based on the requirements identified
3. DESIGN: At this phase, a detailed design of the software,such as user interfaces and components are done.
4. IMPLEMENTATION: This phase usually involves writing the actual code using the appropriate programming languages and tools.
5. TESTING: The software is tested to check if it meets the requirements.
6. DEPLOYMENT: The software is released and made available to the users
7. MAINTAINANCE: Periodical updating and fixing to ensure the software remains relevant 
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
ANS: Waterfall model is a step by step, linear approach to carry out a project. It is suited for straight forward projects that may require less adaptibility.It is suitable for long term projects Some of the advantages of this approach are that it allows planning to be done in advance and it offers a clear roadmap for the project. However, the downside of this approach is that it offers little room for adjustments and readjusting may take a significant amount of time and resources. Agile, on the other hand is flexible and iterative. It allows teams to quickly adjust as needs arise. This ensures that quality products are delivered in the shortest space of time.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
ANS: Requirements engineering refers to the process of analyzing, documenting and managing the requirements of a software system.It ensures that all the needs from the stakeholders are taken care of. It involves:
I. REQUIREMENT ELICITATION: This refers to gathering data from the stakeholders to understand their needs
II. REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS: Interpreting the requirements in order to identify the functional and non-functional parts of the software.
III. REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION: The requirements are summarized in a clear, concise form.
IV. REQUIREMENTS VALIDATION: Verifying the requirements to ensure that they meet the needs
V. REQUIREMENT MANAGEMENT: Managing the requirements throughout the project by tracking and controlling changes. 
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity refers to a concept of breaking down a large, complex program into small modules that can work together. It helps to make the software more reusable, organized and easier to maintain

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
UNIT TESTING: Involves testing the smallest testable part of the software. It is usually done by the developers and not by the testing team
INTEGRATION TESTING:This testing takes a scope of several modules of the software to see if they meet the required standards
SYSTEM TESTING: Completemodules are tested
ACCEPTANCE TESTING: The final testing before delivery. It is done to ensre user needs are met.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
These are softwares that help you to track any changes made to files.They make it easy to colleborate, thereby improving delivery speed.Popular version control systems include Git, Mercurial, Azure DeVops and Bitbucket
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
The project manager organizes and assigns appropriate roles to the team members, manages available resources, sees to it that the project is completed within the specified timelines and that the project meets the stakeholders needs.
Major challenges may include managing internal conlicts between team members, working with limited budgets and handling non- cooperative team members 
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintainace refers to periodical updating and fixing to ensure the software remains relevant, meeting the current user needs. Types of maintainance iclude:
CORRECTIVE: Involves identefying and correcting errors in the software
PERFECTIVE: Adding new features and getting rid of old features that have become irrelevant
PREVENTIVE: Involves dealing with seemingly insignificant issues that may pose a negligible threat at the time. This ensures that a software remains in its optimal state for a  long period of time.
ADAPTIVE: Updating the software to keep up with changes in user needs policies and technologies.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Some of ethical issues faced by software engineers include unauthorized data collection,security concerns and algorithmic bias
To dela with these issues software engineers must exercise accountability, honesty and be proactive 
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
